# about me

Hi! My name is Sávio Mendes, aka **shx**.
I'm an inspired **Software Engineer** with a love for **Devops**, who just want to make fun and engaging projects that people enjoy.

## study

I have a **Technical Degree in System Analysis and Development** and a **Professional Degree in Graphic Design**, so I use the best of my expertise to create projects that resonate with my skills and backgrounds.

I'm currently pursuing a **Bachelor and Teaching Degree on Computer Science** on the **University of Brasília**.

## hobbies

I'm currently developing and maintaining a *self-hosted* **Homelab**, in which i apply multiple principles of **Devsecops**, network, containerization and server administration.

All that documented and well-written declaratively utilizing the **Nix** language with the **NixOS Linux distro**.
